
# dtoid — Eco Nature Zone (Demo)

This is a small static demo site (HTML/CSS/JS) intended to be deployed to GitHub Pages or Netlify.

## Files
- `index.html` — main HTML page
- `styles.css` — CSS styling
- `app.js` — front-end JavaScript
- `favicon.svg` — site favicon

## Quick start (local)
1. Save all files into a folder named `dtoid`.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.

## Deploy to GitHub Pages
1. Create a repo (e.g. `dtoid`) and push the `dtoid` folder files to the `main` branch.
2. In the repository settings -> Pages: set the source to the `main` branch and `/ (root)` folder.
3. Your site will be available at `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/` shortly.

## Deploy to Netlify
1. Drag & drop the `dtoid` folder into Netlify's deploy UI (or connect via Git).
2. Set the publish directory to the repository root.
3. Netlify will give you a URL and auto-deploy on pushes.

## Notes
- Images are hotlinked from Unsplash. Keep internet access for images to load.
- This is a demo: contact & subscribe forms are frontend-only placeholders.
- Feel free to replace images, text, or wire up real form endpoints.

Enjoy — and tell me if you'd like a ZIP file or automated Netlify/GitHub Actions setup.
